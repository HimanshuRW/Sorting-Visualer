when that last element is not found
thats when b9 is not found ... see the dom tree manually in developer tools
and seee whats wrong

and for once ... remove all the useEffects .. make a roung project and understand
what exactly happens when the parent component state chnages .. what happens to child
what happens to its states ... when the component is rendered .. when its use effects r rendered

may be u r doing a mistake here .. that when parend state chnages... u should be using that parent state in child like visual and contols
anf not creating yr own array bcz ... we just chainging array of state  but not calling set_state of parent
and set state of parent will be only called when algo chnages or size chnages
thus that will cause Visual to load again

and keep track of values u affect like background color and ids
bcz u need to reset then all when u call visual
so make u can write a code for it ... without useEffect in visual before returning

and in controls may be ... u r rendering the component twice.. one when parent reloaed
and second bcz of useState of its own regarding array
may be use can useEffect with array only to reset array when array chnages
or or or better approad.. dont use states ... just use useEffect s it will be runned only only when 
parent component reload that will cause to load Controls again and !! now every time parents load...
first Contols will be unmounted ... so u can use useEffect cleanup funtion to reset the contols world
