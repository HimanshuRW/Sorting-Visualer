## Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HimanshuRW/Sorting-Visualer.git
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start

## Project Structure
  - `App.js:` Main component containing the core logic and rendering of the visualizer.
  - `components:` Directory containing various React components used in the project.
    - `mini_components:` Subdirectory containing smaller utility components.
  - `algorithms:` Directory containing the implementations of sorting algorithms.
  - `App.css:` Stylesheet for styling the components.

## Usage
  - `Choice Component (Choice.jsx):` Allows users to switch between different sorting algorithms.
  - `Slider Component (Slider.jsx):` Enables users to adjust the speed and size of the array being sorted.
  - `Btn Component (Btn.jsx):` Provides control buttons for starting/pausing the visualization and resetting the array.

## Sorting Algorithms
The project currently supports the visualization of the following sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort

## Features
  - `Real-time Visualization:` Witness the sorting algorithms in action with real-time visualization of each step.
  - `Interactive Controls:` Adjust the speed and size of the array to tailor the visualization experience.
  - `Algorithm Choice:` Switch between different sorting algorithms on-the-fly.
